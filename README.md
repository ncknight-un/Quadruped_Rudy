# 🐾 Meet Rudy!

Executables: 
~ Calibration: Using calibrate.launch.xml, you can read the encoder positions at a zero'd joint positions to calibrate each motors encoding to a joint position of 0.

Rudy is a small quadruped robot that I have designed and begun building completely from scratch. This project focuses on full-stack robotics development — spanning mechanical design, electronics integration, motor control, and ROS-based software architecture.

# Software Architecture

- Raspberry Pi  
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Desktop  
- ROS 2 Kilted  
- Dynamixel SDK Package

# Mechanical Design
## Initial Range of Motion (ROM) Goals

Each leg was designed with:

- **Two degrees of freedom at the hip:**
  - Abduction / Adduction  
  - Flexion / Extension  

- **One degree of freedom at the knee:**
  - Flexion / Extension  

Hip abduction was intentionally included to enable:

- Center-of-mass shifting  
- Improved balance during locomotion  
- Future dynamic gait stability

# Project Vision

Rudy is intended to evolve into a fully capable research and experimentation platform for:

- Legged locomotion control  
- Gait generation and optimization  
- ROS-based robotics architecture  
- Balance and COM shifting strategies  

This project represents a complete ground-up robotics system — mechanical, electrical, and software — built to deepen expertise in integrated robotic systems design.
